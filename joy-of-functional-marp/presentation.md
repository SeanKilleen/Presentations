# Gherkin Syntax

---

#### Gherkin Syntax

* Given
* When
* Then

---

#### Gherkin Syntax

Old and busted:

```
A system shall allow login access 
```

---

#### Gherkin Syntax

New hotness:

```
Given I am on the home page
  And I have clicked the login button
When I enter a valid username
  And I enter a valid password
  And I login
Then I should be redirected to my profile page
```
