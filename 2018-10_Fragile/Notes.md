# (FR)Agile

## How it falls apart

* Fear
* Mistrust
* Metrics
* Focus on the short-term
* Project thinking instead of product thinking
* Forgetting about value
* Feature factories
* Lack of production thinking
* Adherence to prescriptions
* Neglecting tools / techniques / lessons outside of the agile spectrum
* Stakeholder shifts / changes
* Agile seen as snake oil
* Multiple teams
* Forgetting about the values of the agile manifesto, subbing processes instead
* Inability to experiment
* "Surface-level team" -- not doing the hard work of getting in there and making a team into a team
* Overloading roles & people
* Missing engineering principles leading to fire-fighting
* Forgetting the general value proposition of agile: you eventually run out of money or time. How do you deliver what's valuable now? (sometimes everyone wants everything)
* No "decider"
* Points or similarly flawed measurements becoming too central to the process. 

## How you can keep it altogether

* Occasionally call into question your prescribed processes
* Be willing to be the person who gives the feedback
* Create a culture of challenge & support for that challenge
* Constantly think about the value provided by your prescribed processes.
* Technical excellence is not optional
* Keeping stakeholders at the correct distance at the right time. Does a client need to be in planning? Yes. Does a client need to be in retros? Ideally but not necessarily. Does a client need to understand test coverage or points? Not necessarily.
* Always keep your team's psychological safety & well-being front & center.
* Understand the hierarchy of needs in your given situation. How do you move from one level to the next?
