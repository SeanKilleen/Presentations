# Sean's Presentations

A catalog of the presentations I've given or am planning to give.

I figured since I want to expand this list, I should create a central place for them to live. :)

## Have Something You'd Like to See?

[Let me know](mailto:SeanKilleen@gmail.com) -- maybe I can present on it!

| Attack-a the Akka! | June 15, 2016 | [TechTalk DC (Arlington, VA)](http://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/231392513/) | A revised update of a previous Akka.NET introductory presentation. I'll endeavor to explain concepts and benefits behind the actor model, show how Akka.NET enables such a model with relative ease, and demonstrate some of the top features of the framework via code samples / demos. I have some additional time this go-round, so I'm hoping I'll be able to add some more code samples.
| Attack-a the Akka! | July 26, 2016 | [Capital Area .NET Users Group (Vienna, VA)](http://www.meetup.com/CapArea-Net/events/231217207/) | A revised update of a previous Akka.NET introductory presentation.

I have some additional time this go-round, so I'm hoping I'll be able to add some more code samples.
| [TeamCity and OctopusDeploy: So Happy Together](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/Presentations/tree/master/2016-02-18_TCAndOcto_DevOpsDC) | Feb 16, 2016 | [DevOps DC Meetup (Reston, VA)](http://www.meetup.com/DevOpsDC/events/226750186/) | This presentation sought to explain the pleasantly symbiotic relationship between a build server such as [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and a release tool, such as [OctopusDeploy](https://octopus.com/). There weren't as many .NET-focused developers there as expected, and time was a little short, but I'm looking forward to making some tweaks to this one and giving it again soon. |
