Feedback Loops

Ideas for Imagery to use throughout

* Fruit loops
* Roller coaster
* Shoe laces / knots
* Skywriting loops?


Why do we want to make our feedback loops as small as possible?

* Every feedback loop you have is a chance to improve
* Every feedback loop is a chance to change course
* If you can adapt 100 times, you're more likely to reach and exceed goals than adapting twice

How does this apply?

* OSS 
* Code in general - Manual testing vs UAT vs CI build vs local Integration test vs local unit test vs continuously run tests
* Team interactions - Release retro vs sprint retro vs stan-up vs pair programming vs mobbing
* Presentations -- feedback form vs dry run vs. multiple dry runs vs pairing 
* Job search -- resume cattle calls vs job boards vs building relationships
* Career -- job transitions vs yearly review vs biweekly check-in vs asking for feedback continuously* 
 
All of the feelings!

* Feedback loops can feel like a roller coaster
* They can feel like overload
* Remember that they represent opportunity

Asking for feedback doesn't mean you have to apply all the feedback!


Feedback loops are like mulligans in golf

Also, the XC is like a feedback loop for your career. Because you're starting out early with real work, you're getting experience early on and you can adjust the trajectory of both your learning and your career. The best kind of feedback loop is starting a rewarding and fulfilling career early.

Agile, devops, Docker containers, and more. If you want to spot the upcoming Trends in technology, look for the Technologies and processes that shorten feedback loops. Companies that learn faster and developers that move faster are the ones who make the difference

Categories where feedback loops matter include development, deployment, infrastructure, process, career, testing, team building, performance


Regular feedback loops also help uncover patterns. If you have a cycle that repeats every day and the same thing comes up again and again, it's easy then if you only check in once every month
